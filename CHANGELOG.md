## build-1 — fork of unified vcommunity → vcommunity-vsphere (2026-06-23)

`feat(adapter): fork the unified vCommunity adapter into the vcommunity-vsphere pak`

STEP 2 of the vCommunity vsphere/os split
(`designs/managementpacks/vcommunity-three-adapter-split.md`). Forked the unified
`vcfcf_vcommunity` adapter (build 11) into this fresh-lineage
`vcfcf_vcommunity_vsphere` pak and stripped the in-guest guest-ops surface (now
owned by the `vcommunity-os` pak, STEP 1). Fresh build numbering starts at 1.

**Kept (the vSphere pak's surface — the bulk):**
- `ClusterCollector.java` (HA/DRS/EVC/DRS Score), `HostCollector.java` (advanced
  system settings, packages/VIBs, install date, licensing, NIC uplinks), and the
  vSphere-side branch of `VmCollector` (snapshot count, VM options, advanced
  parameters, SCSI controllers).
- **The passive VMware-Tools `Guest OS|Operating System|*` keys** —
  `VCommunityVSphereClient.vmGuestOsInfo(...)` AND its live caller in
  `VmCollector.collectConfig` that pushes `vCommunity|Guest OS|Operating System|*`
  (vim25 `guest.detailedData`, no Windows credential). While `vcommunity-os` is
  shelved, this pak is the SOLE writer of these six keys (design OPEN-A refinement).
- The plumbing for its OWN vCenter session + stitch: `VCommunityVSphereClient`,
  `VCommunityStitcher`, `SolutionConfigStore`, the `SuiteApiStitcher` usage
  (deliberate duplication per design §2 — not shared with the os pak).
- The vCenter credential kind (`vsphere_user`, user/password).
- The four vSphere SolutionConfig XMLs (`esxi_advanced_system_settings.xml`,
  `esxi_packages.xml`, `vm_advanced_parameters.xml`, `vm_options.xml`) and their
  adapter-instance config-file fields.
- All 37 super metrics, the vSphere views, 12 dashboards, and the
  `ESXi Host NIC Disconnected` symptom + alert.
- **The build-2 `VMEntityVCID` stitch-scoping fix — retained verbatim**, wired
  from the live SOAP session via `stitcher.setOwningVcUuid(vsphere.getVCenterInstanceUuid())`
  (`lessons/stitch-moid-not-unique-across-vcenters.md`, design Risk #2).

**Stripped (guest-OS — belongs to vcommunity-os):**
- `GuestOpsClient.java` entirely.
- The guest-ops branch of `VmCollector` (Windows services, Windows event logs,
  in-guest CSV OS-info via `getWindowsOSInformation.ps1`) and the build-9/10
  guest-ops diagnostics (`guestops_ready`/`guestops_skips`/`guestops_last_error`
  anchor properties and their `Result` fields).
- The Windows credential fields (`winUser`/`winPass`), the `WindowsMonitoring`
  enum and its two describe.xml enums (`serviceMonitoring`/`winEventMonitoring`).
- The two Windows SolutionConfig XMLs (`windows_service_list.xml`,
  `windows_event_list.xml`) and their config-file fields.
- The three guest-ops `.ps1` scripts and the now-empty `profiles/scripts` dir.
- Windows-only content: the `Windows Service Down` symptom + alert and the
  `Windows Services vCommunity` view.

**Re-identity:** adapter kind `vcfcf_vcommunity` → `vcfcf_vcommunity_vsphere`; MP
display name → `VCF Content Factory vCommunity vSphere`; describe.xml,
adapter.yaml, icons.yaml, resources.properties, README/REFERENCE/docs all updated.
Fresh git lineage (initial commit, not a continuation of the unified history).

## Carried gaps (from the unified pak)

- **TOOLSET GAP #1 — foreign-resource event push.** Host install-date read
  failures ship as alertable properties, not real events (Suite API facade has no
  event endpoint). Real events → **v1.1**.
